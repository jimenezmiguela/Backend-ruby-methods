#sort_blocks.rb
# (5) The ruby array sort method can use a block to sort various arrays.  The block
# must compare between two elements of the array, a and b.
# If a<b, it should evaluate to
# -1.  If a==b, it should evaluate to 0.  And if a>b, it should evaluate to 1.
# Here is the
# start of a program, which you should call sort_blocks.rb.

# ```ruby
# class Book
#   attr_reader :author, :title, :count
#   def initialize(author,title,count)
#     @author = author
#     @title = title
#     @count = count
#   end
#   def to_s
#     "author: #{author} title: #{title} count: #{count}"
#   end
# end
#
# book_array = []
# book_array.push(Book.new("Beatrice Potter","Peter Rabbit",25))
# book_array.push(Book.new("Henry Fielding","Tom Jones",12))
# book_array.push(Book.new("Bob Woodward","All the President's Men",30))
#
# puts "Sorting alphabetically by author"
#
# new_array = book_array.sort do |a,b|
#   author1 = a.author.downcase
#   author2 = b.author.downcase
#   author1 <=> author2
#   # if author1 > author2
#   #   1
#   # elsif author1 < author2
#   #   -1
#   # else
#   #   0
#   # end
# end
# puts new_array
# ```

# Note the use of the spaceship operator <=>.  It does what the commented out
# lines do, but on one line.
#
# Add to this program. Add additional calls to book_array.sort that pass blocks.
# For your first
# call to sort, pass a block so that the array is sorted in order of title,
# and print out the array.  For your second call to sort, pass a block so that
# the array is sorted in order of copies, and print out the array.

class Book
  attr_reader :author, :title, :count
  def initialize(author,title,count)
    @author = author
    @title = title
    @count = count
  end
  def to_s
    "author: #{author} title: #{title} count: #{count}"
  end
end

  # and print out the array.
